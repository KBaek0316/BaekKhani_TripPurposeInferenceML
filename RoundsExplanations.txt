Round 1: explored multiple categorical vars consolidations with OHE with 6-level target with obj=mean(acc,wf1)-0.05 zeropreds

Round 2 trial 1: explored binary consolidations with all cat encoding with 3-level target (W/H/O) and extended range of denom and encdim; obj=mean(acc,wf1)

Round 2 trial 2: Finalized parameter spaces and employed 4-level target(W/H/O/Shop) but until this stage; obj=wf1; has some intermediate results before final hp spaces fixed

Round 2 trial 3: same with trial 2 but obj=adj_accuracy and for RF, infinite depth option or (depth=200) has been removed, and now trials store strict accuracy and work_f1 regardless of the object; trial numbers decreased to 50 and 110, respectively
